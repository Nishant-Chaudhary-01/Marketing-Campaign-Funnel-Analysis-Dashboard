An end-to-end business intelligence project that provides a comprehensive analysis of marketing campaign performance. This interactive Power BI dashboard tracks the entire customer journey, from initial ad spend and user activity to final conversion and revenue generation, enabling data-driven optimization of marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

- An end-to-end data analytics project designed to transform raw marketing data from multiple sources into a cohesive, interactive dashboard.
- This dashboard provides actionable insights into key business metrics like Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), customer conversion rates, and funnel drop-offs.
- The project showcases a complete data workflow: defining KPIs in SQL, performing data cleaning and complex aggregations in Python, and building a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard in Power BI.
- It is built to simulate real-world business scenarios, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions to maximize marketing ROI.

## Data Source

This dataset was synthetically generated using Google Gemini to simulate a real-world digital marketing campaign, including interconnected data on user activity, sales, and customer demographics for analytical purposes.

## Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **Python (Pandas & Jupyter Notebook)** ‚Äì For data cleaning, transformation, and pre-aggregation of complex KPIs. All 7 core KPIs were calculated in Python before being exported.
- **SQL** ‚Äì Used to define the initial business logic and structure for the 7 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- **Power BI** ‚Äì For data modeling, creating interactive visualizations, and building the final dashboard.
- **DAX** ‚Äì For creating high-level, dynamic summary measures for the dashboard's main KPI cards (e.g., Overall ROAS, Total Revenue).
- **Power Query (M)** ‚Äì For importing the data sources into Power BI and performing final data type checks.
